This repo is created to show subjects below:


* **Python** file usage as a library in robot framework.
* **Selenium** framework usage in robot framework.
* **Serial**,**Telnet**,**SSH** connection examples for robot framework.
* Can calculate **the time** it would take a browser
  to download and **execute** your JS. Time is a much more accurate
  and understandable metric compared to the size in bytes.
* Calculations include **all dependencies and polyfills**
  used in your JS.
